## Hangman Game

In this project I created a hangman like game from scratch.

### Initial design criteria:
- Create a hangman game using UI kit

- Choose a random word from an array and present it to the user as a series of underscores

- The user can then guess the letters one at a time. Correct guesses will fill in the blanks.

### Initial deign thoughts
 - Hangman will be a series of pictures loaded based on # of wrong ansers
 
 -  The user will enter guesses by tapping on an array of letter buttons arranged in a sub view. these button will be hidden once used.
 
 - The Answer / hint information will be loaded at random from a text file (in background) of answers and hints
 
 - The app will load into a start screen with a button on it, then into the game.
 
 - a reset button will remove all guesses, reset image and load a different random answer from the text file.
